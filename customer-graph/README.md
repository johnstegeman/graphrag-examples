## Setup Neo4j DB
The workflow requires a Neo4j DB with Graph Data Science. We recommend using Aura Pro for this.  You can access a 2-week trial for free and the setup is easy. 

If you need a free version beyond those two weeks see Desktop, Server, or Docker installation instructions [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation).
